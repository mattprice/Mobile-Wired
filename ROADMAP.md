# Roadmap

## Version 1.1

* Highlight nickname mentions in the ChatView.
* Improve connection error messages (?)
* Sort the server list by connection status then manually/name (default).
    * This should probably be another global option.
* Have the UITextField expand for long chat messages.
* Add the ability to edit bookmarks while connected
    - Display a warning that some changes won't take affect until next connection.
* UserInfoView cells should dynamically grow if necessary (like the chat messages).

## Version 1.2

* Send and receive Private Messages.
* Extend push notifications to support:
    * Connect / Disconnects
    * Private messages
    * Keyword mentions
* Add ability to kick/ban users.

## Version 2.x

* SSL connection
* Landscape mode
* iPad support

## Feature Ideas

* Icons when setting up a bookmark that show if the server/login information is valid.
* Ability to send attachments to chat (CloudApp or similar?)
